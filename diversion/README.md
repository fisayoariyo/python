# Readme

I had to create a diversion directory because I found another material different from w3schools' and I think I may have omiited some other things that might be important as I have now found a material suggested by somebody from the internet, in his words "Run through Learn Pythin the Hardway.......and learn libraries and you are good to go ....." and so I have now decided to learn ython like a smart person, hence this diversion folder.
