Learning about Python Operators may be fun or not

Apparently, there is not so much to learn about python operators, I also learnt about python the type of operators there are, including: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Identity, Memebership, Bitwise.
I also learnt about Operator precedence. Well, that is all for now. On to the next!
