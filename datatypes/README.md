	sequence types	list, tuple, range
	mapping type	dict
	set type	set, frozenset
	boolean type	bool(e.g, TRUE)
	binary type	bytes, bytesarray, memoryview

Also learnt about assigning variable.
	A variable assigned outside a function is a global variable and a local variable is assigned
	-within a function and can only work within the function. A global cvariable can be called by		anypne and anywhere.
